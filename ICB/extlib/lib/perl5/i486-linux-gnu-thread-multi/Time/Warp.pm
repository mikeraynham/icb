=head1 NAME

Time::Warp - control over the flow of time

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Time::Warp qw(scale to time);

    to(time + 5);  # 5 seconds ahead
    scale(2);      # make time flow twice normal

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Our external experience unfolds in 3 1/2 dimensions (time has a
dimensionality of 1/2).  The Time::Warp module offers developers
control over the measurement of time.

=over 4

=item * to($desired_time)

The theory of relativity asserts that all physical laws are enforced
relative to the observer.  Since the starting point of time is
arbitrary, it is permissable to change it.  This has the effect of
making it appear as if time is moving forwards or backward
instanteously.  For example, on some types of operating systems time
starts at Wed Dec 31 19:00:00 1969 (this will likely change as we
approach 2030 and with the acceptance of 64-bit CPUs).

  to(time + 60*60);       # 1 hour ahead

=item * scale($factor)

Changes the speed at which time is progressing.

  scale(scale * 2);   # double the speed of time

Note that it is not possible to stop time or cause it to reverse since
this is forbidden by the second law of thermodynamics.
